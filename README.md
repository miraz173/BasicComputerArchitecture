# BasicComputerArchitecture
The aim of this project is to showcase the fundamental design and operation of a CPU and RAM, demonstrating how they function together to execute basic programs in a computer. By simulating their interaction, this project will illustrate the core principles of computer architecture and the processes that drive program execution at the hardware lvl.
